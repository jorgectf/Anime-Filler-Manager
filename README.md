This is for my IB CS IA

Anime Filler Manager is a Java application to search for anime from \
[MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) \
and find out which episodes of that anime are **filler** (unnecessary to watch), according to the amazing community-led \
[Anime Filler List](https://www.animefillerlist.com/).
